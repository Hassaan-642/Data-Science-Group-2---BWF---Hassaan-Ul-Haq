    "### . CV(Cross Validation) score tells us that how well the model will perform on new/unseen data. \n",
    "### . It Evaluates how well a model generalizes to new data by using multiple training and validation splits.\n",
    "### . It Provides a reliable estimate of model performance where Higher CV scores indicate better performance on new data, while consistent scores suggest model stability."

    "### My understanding Of Overfitting\n",
    "### . Overfitting occurs when a model learns irrrelevant data during training to the extent that it negatively impacts its performance on new, unseen data. \n",
    "### . When there is less training data, model learns irreleveant data rather than general pattrens which results to lower accuracy on unseen data despite having high accuracy on training data.\n",
    "### . Overfitting can be reduced by using cross-validation, or pruning(removing parts of model that do not add much value) to improve the modelâ€™s ability to handle new data.\n"

    "### My understanding of Underfitting\n",
    "### . Underfitting happens when a model is too basic to understand the patterns in the data.\n",
    "### . As a result, it performs poorly on both the training data and new data. Thus It leads to lower accuracy.\n",
    "### . Increasing model complexity can help address underfitting by allowing the model to learn more from the data."
